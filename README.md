# Merger-and-Acquisition-Analysis
For our project, we analysed the stock prices of companies that have undergone Merger and Acquisition. We wished to analyse the fluctuations in the companyâ€™s stock when the M&amp;A is announced, through statistical tests. Initially, we observed the log returns of each individual stock and then proceeded to compare the log returns of the pairs of stocks to see if they are correlated and if we can gain productive business insights from the analysis.
